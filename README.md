This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose

This project has been created with the goal to practice the following technologies:

- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) - set of primitive building blocks to design a project UI.
- [Panda](https://panda-css.com/) - CSS Library that provides styling solution for modern web browsers.

### Challenge

After reading the documentation about Radix UI and Panda CSS, I developed this layout simulating a profile editing screen. An example of this layout has been provided on production ([Profile UI](https://profile-ui-panda-radix.vercel.app/)):

## Setup

In order to run the tutorials, you will have initially to setup the project locally. Make it sure you have run:

```bash
npm run setup
```

That 'setup' command will clean all built (auto-generated) directories and files, besides cleaning npm cache, which is necessary sometimes since Panda might be getting cached by NextJs. Therefore, stop the server and run the setup whenever is needed.

## Run

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
