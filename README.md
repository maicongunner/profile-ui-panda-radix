This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Purpose

- [Panda](https://panda-css.com/) - CSS Library that provides styling solution for modern web browsers.

### Challenge

After reading the documentation about Radix UI and Panda CSS, I developed this layout simulating a profile editing screen:
